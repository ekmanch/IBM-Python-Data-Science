# IBM Python Data Science Program

This is my GitHub repository for a program of courses offered by IBM through www.edx.org on learning to code in Python.  
Program Name:  [Python Data Science](https://www.edx.org/professional-certificate/python-data-science)

The program consist of the following 5 courses:

Course Order | Course ID | Course Name
------------ | ------------- | -------------
01 | IBM PY0101EN | Python Basics for Data Science
02 | IBM DA0101EN | Analyzing Data with Python
03 | IBM TBC | Visualizing Data with Python
04 | IBM TBC | Machine Learning with Python: A Practical Introduction
05 | IBM TBC | Data Science and Machine Learning Capstone Project

## Course Descriptions

The contents and descriptions of the IBM courses are as below.

# Python Basics for Data Science

# Analyzing Data with Python

Welcome to Data science with python, in this course, you will go over everything from how to load data, to building basic machine learning models. Each level in the pyramid summarises concepts you will learn in each module. The outer labels give a general summary, as you can see this course will start you off with the basics, the libraries you need and how to work with data. You will learn how to analyze data using summary statistics; this section is useful if you would like to make an argument with data. Finally, you will learn how to build Machine Learning Models and see how these models work in the real world.
